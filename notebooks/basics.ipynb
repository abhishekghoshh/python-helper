    "The values of a dictionary can be any legal Python (including objects, functions, lists, other dictionaries and so on). The keys, however, have to be hashable - that is, they must be able to be transformed by some hash function into a single value. Simple object like integers and string literals are hashable, and so you can use them as dictionary keys. This is because it is possible to define a function that will process a string literal, for example, and always produce the same number for the same literal. But a list in Python can contain anything, even other lists, functions and dictionaries, so there is no way to define a single standard hash function that works on all lists. So lists are not hashable and you canâ€™t use them as dictionary keys."
